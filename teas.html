        Flowers should be 100% dried after harvest if you want to enjoy them as
        tea later. This can be done in the oven on the baking tray at the lowest
        setting. Fine flowers are dry after just 30 minutes (at 60 degrees).
        <br />Often it is enough to choose a flower for a tea, such as sage,
        chamomile, elderflower, peppermint or lemon verbena. These all have a
        very intense taste.<br />
        <div class="emphasis">
          If you want to make a mixture, start with an intense main herb that
          forms the majority of the mixture and is the most dominant in its
          aroma, e.g. peppermint. Then add the herbs that are important for
          their effects such as raspberry leaves, rose hips, elder flowers. For
          decoration, you can complement everything with marigolds, cornflowers,
          sunflowers or mallows, which will bring color into the mix.

          For flowers you don't know, look them up in the dictionary first so
          you don't come across any poisonous ones.
