        <h4>
          When breeding a new variety of roses professionally, everything begins
          with crossing two plants. In order to transfer the desired
          characteristics to a new rose variety, it is not enough to cross just
          one generation with a mother plant. Characteristics such as an intense
          scent can skip several generations and then suddenly reappear in the
          great-grandchild. It is therefore difficult to predict what properties
          the new rose will ultimately have.

        <h4>
          If you want to cross two roses together, you first select a mother
          plant in the summer and remove the petals and stamens from its
          flowers. The striking pistil in the middle of the flower is female,
          the pollen surrounding it is male. You now need the pollen dust from a
          parent variety. The pollen sack is carefully removed, dried and the
          fine pollen is then applied to the pistil of the mother variety with a
          brush.<br />
